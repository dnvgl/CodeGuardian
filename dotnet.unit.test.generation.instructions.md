# Unit Test Generation Prompt

## Purpose
Generate high-quality, maintainable unit tests for C# classes using xUnit, following .NET unit testing best practices.
## Requirements
- there are 3 kind of way to generate unit tests:
  1. If the user specified a class or file, please generate unit tests for all methods in the current class.
  2. If the user minded to generate tests for full project files, please give a plan of action, then generate the tests if the user agrees with the plan.
  3. If the user did not specify any class or file, please generate unit tests for all methods in the changed files since last pull.
- If you can't find the unit test files, please generate unit test files for the class with the same name as the class, but with the suffix `Tests` (e.g., `MyClassTests.cs`). if you not sure the path of the new UT file, please ask for it.
- Please review the code again after it was generated, If you found any code that can be reused, please create a separate method for it and share the method in multiple testings.
- please run the tests after they are generated, if you found any errors, please fix them.

## Key Guidelines
- Use the **Arrange/Act/Assert** pattern in every test.
- Each test should be **independent** and **repeatable**.
- Use **descriptive test method names** that clearly state the scenario and expected outcome.
- **Test both success and failure paths** (including exceptions).
- **Mock all dependencies** (use Moq).
- Type to mock dependencies should be interfaces or abstract classes.
- **One logical assertion(One condition for judgment) per test** (where practical).
- **Keep tests focused**: test one behavior per test.
- **Avoid testing implementation details**; test public API/behavior.
- Use **Shouldly** or xUnit assertions for clarity.
- **No reliance on external state** (e.g., databases, files, network).
- for Mocking HttpContext issue. please follow the Example below:
```csharp
        private readonly Mock<IHttpContextAccessor> _httpContextAccessorMock = new();

        public ConstructorTests()
        {            
            var httpContext = new DefaultHttpContext();
            httpContext.Request.Headers["X-Forwarded-Host"] = "demo.dnv.com"; // Mock headers
            _httpContextAccessorMock.Setup(h => h.HttpContext).Returns(httpContext);

            _service = new DemoService(
                _httpContextAccessorMock.Object);
        }
```

## Test Frameworks and Tools
- **xUnit** for test framework.
- **Moq** for mocking dependencies.
- **Shouldly** for assertions (optional, but preferred for readability).

## Example Test
[Fact]
public async Task GetUserById_UserExists_ReturnsUser()
{
    // Arrange
    var userId = "123";
    var expectedUser = new User { Id = userId };
    userRepositoryMock.Setup(r => r.GetUserById(userId)).ReturnsAsync(expectedUser);
    
    // Act
    var result = await sut.GetUserById(userId);

    // Assert
    result.ShouldBe(expectedUser);
}

## What to Provide
- Signatures or summaries of any dependencies/interfaces.
- Any special requirements (e.g., edge cases, error handling, coverage goals).

## What to Generate
- A C# test class file with xUnit `[Fact]` methods.
- Each test should follow Arrange/Act/Assert.
- Cover both typical and edge/error cases.
- Use Moq for all dependencies.
- Use Shouldly for assertions.
